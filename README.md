# Holistic Skill Intelligence Platform

## Problem Statement
Problem Statement 3 – Holistic Academic and Professional Skill Intelligence System for Emerging Sectors

---

## Project Overview
Students and early-career professionals often struggle to understand how their academic performance, projects, and practical skills align with real-world industry requirements. Existing platforms focus on isolated indicators such as grades, certifications, or resumes, without providing integrated insights or actionable guidance for future growth.

This project presents a **Holistic Skill Intelligence Platform** that continuously captures, organizes, and analyzes a user’s academic and professional journey. The system identifies skill gaps, estimates career readiness, recommends personalized learning paths, and visualizes progression for emerging sectors such as **Healthcare Technology, Agricultural Technology, and Smart City Systems**.

Unlike static profiles, this platform functions as a **living system** that evolves with the user over time.

---

## Key Features
- User profile management for skills, courses, projects, and certifications
- Deterministic skill-gap analysis using sector-specific frameworks
- Career readiness scoring (0–100%)
- Personalized course and project recommendations
- Interactive dashboards for skill progression and gaps
- Secure authentication using Firebase
- External API integration (real or simulated)

---

## System Architecture

The system follows a modular, layered architecture to ensure scalability, clarity, and extensibility.

### Frontend Layer
Built with React, the frontend provides user interfaces for profile management, career selection, and dashboard visualization.

### Backend Layer
Implemented using FastAPI, the backend exposes RESTful APIs for profile management, skill processing, and coordination with the intelligence engine.

### Intelligence Engine
A deterministic, weighted skill-gap scoring engine evaluates user skills against role-specific frameworks to compute a **Career Readiness Index** and generate recommendations.

### Data Layer
User data, skill frameworks, and mappings are stored using relational models (SQLite for development, PostgreSQL-ready for production).

### External Integrations
Optional integrations with LinkedIn, GitHub, and learning platforms enhance profile context. Mocked integrations are used where live access is unavailable.

## Machine Learning and Skill Intelligence

The platform implements a **deterministic, weighted skill-gap scoring engine** for role readiness estimation.

This is a **rule-based, explainable, and domain-grounded intelligence system**, designed for transparency and reproducibility rather than opaque prediction.

### Skill-Gap Scoring Model
- Each career role has a predefined skill framework
- Each skill is assigned a weight based on industry relevance
- User skills are matched against the framework
- A readiness score is computed (0–100%)

The output is a **Career Readiness Index**, representing alignment between a user’s current skills and the selected role.

### Recommendation Logic
Skills with the highest weighted gaps are prioritized. Learning resources (courses/projects) mapped to those skills are recommended to maximize readiness improvement.

---

## Dataset

The intelligence engine is informed by a publicly available Kaggle dataset:

- **Dataset Name:** LinkedIn Jobs and Skills (1–3M)
- **Source:** Kaggle
- **URL:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asaniczka/1-3m-linkedin-jobs-and-skills-2024

The dataset provides job-role-to-skill mappings at scale. It was used to:
- Identify common skill requirements per role
- Inform skill framework construction
- Support weighting strategies

Preprocessing included filtering domain-relevant roles, normalizing skill names, and aggregating frequencies.
